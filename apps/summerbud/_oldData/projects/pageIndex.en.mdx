# What I am working on 

I like programming and solving daily problems.

These projects are mostly about solving my personal daily problems or questions. In totuslink I try to research the consequence when we heavily rely on "listing structure". I try to solve the pain point about collecting reference with hologram and enhence the ability of discussion platform using pnyx.

Every projects symbolize every thought process I have in my life, if you are interested in detail, you may find usefull in every project's github repo or you can directly mail me. I am very willing to answer further question about these projects.
