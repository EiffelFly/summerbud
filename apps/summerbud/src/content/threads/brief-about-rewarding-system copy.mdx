I've been consistently asking myself this question. I have witnessed many startups fail, including my own. There are numerous determinants that can alter their destiny, and I believe the only common thread is the ability to learn—not just superficial learning, but a deep, core understanding.

Let me explain the difference between superficial learning and profound learning. Many might consider learning as the ability to absorb outcomes and quickly adapt to different directions. However, I view this as a form of false learning.

Consider a scientist in a laboratory. If they begin an experiment by randomly choosing experiment variants—sometimes one, sometimes multiple—what will be the result? The answer is clear: the scientist will likely make no significant discoveries for the scientific community.

True learning, in my mind, follows a different approach. In the world of startups or any creative endeavor, everyone is trying to navigate an uncertain, complex landscape where no one knows the definitive path from the outset. The true hidden advantage lies in the ability to identify your weakest points, form assumptions, and then create a series of experiments to validate those assumptions.

Sometimes you might taste success, but the majority of experiences will still end in failure. However, by maintaining clear assumptions and controlled variables, you can genuinely learn from each attempt and adjust your direction to test new hypotheses.

The beauty of this approach is the logical comprehension it creates among team members. Everyone understands the current biggest and weakest assumptions and how they will be tested. If successful, you might discover something valuable and continue testing the next weakest assumption. If you fail, all team members understand the experiment's structure. They won't feel lost with sudden directional changes; they can even contribute to brainstorming new directions as they become familiar with the process.

This becomes a culture I deeply admire—the culture of experimentation. Whenever we feel lost, we can look back and learn from Darwin and other great scientists who bravely made assumptions, cleverly controlled variables, consistently conducted experiments, validate the outcomes, and most importantly, assumed they knew nothing about the potential results.
