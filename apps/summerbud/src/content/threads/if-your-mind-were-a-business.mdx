"If your mind were a business, would you be bankrupt from consuming more than you produce?"

Yes.

We consume tens of thousands of pieces of information every day, and it has become far more overwhelming than before. When we watch YouTube, dozens of ads about new games compete for our attention. When we read articles, recommendations flood the sidebars. When we scroll through short videos, we find ourselves on an endless downward path.

Every bit of information seems to yell at us, demanding our attention. Content is constantly moving, flickering, and changing. This creates an illusion that we're learning many things each day, but the reality is that this information cannot form into knowledge without proper crystallization.

Our brain is a giant, dynamic vault that prioritizes energy efficiency and consistently seeks ways to reduce energy costs. Without deliberate engagement, it will operate at minimum capacity. The consequence is that information fails to stick and connect with existing knowledge, instead being washed away by the constant flood of new inputs.

On the surface, your brain might appear information-rich, with numerous transactions occurring simultaneously. However, without creating lasting knowledge, it gradually loses value and eventually goes bankrupt. The symptoms manifest as increasing anxiety toward information, inability to form original opinions, and difficulty creating meaningful work.

Treat your brain like a company – it needs to produce meaningful work to remain relevant. At first, you don't need to immediately challenge yourself with writing a 3,000-word essay. Start small: write a diary summarizing what you've learned today and identify meaningful pieces of information. Then expand to weekly and monthly reviews to track your learning over time. Use this accumulated knowledge to create something tangible – whether it's an essay, an artwork, a product, or an app. Create something that solves your problems or satisfies your interests.

Don't forget: the ultimate goal of consuming information is to create something meaningful.
