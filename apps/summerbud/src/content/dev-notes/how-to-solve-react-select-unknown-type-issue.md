When working with React-select and typescript, one of the advantages is auto type detecting. React-select will digest your prop's type and make it universal inside the component. For example, React-select will digest the option prop and use the type in opChange props. This is very convenient.

Here comes the pitfall. When you return the wrong type back to React-select, it will get confused and rollback Option type to its original type which is Unknown. 

```js
interface SelectProps<
  Option = unknown,
  IsMulti extends boolean = false,
  Group extends GroupBase<Option> = GroupBase<Option>
> {
 ...
}
```

> If TypeScript can't detect what type this should be, it defaults to `unknown`.

This seldom happens when the use case is simple, but when you want to adjust lots of React-select's props, it will cause some issues. Like the example below, when dealing with the custom component, if you cast the wrong type at componentâ€™s props, React-select will get confused and rollback its Option's type.

```js
<ReactSelect
  options={options}
  onChange={onChangeHandler}
  components={{
	// This will cause issue
    ClearIndicator: (props: ClearIndicatorProps) => {...},
  }}
/>
```

The correct way of doing so, if you don't need to do anything fancy of type checking is you let the prop's type inherit from React-select itself.

```js
<ReactSelect
  options={options}
  onChange={onChangeHandler}
  components={{
	// This will cause issue
    ClearIndicator: (props) => {...},
  }}
/>
```

And the React-select will correctly get the type!
