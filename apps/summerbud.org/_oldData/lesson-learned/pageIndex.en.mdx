# Lesson learned intro

The articles of lesson learned will be as concise as possible. Every article's words count will limit to 1000 and follow identical structure:

1. Intro: Will briefly introduce when and why I encounter the problem.
2. How: How to solve the problem. When it comes to programming, every solution will couple with simple code example. For topics about literature, writing and startup it will come with actionable practice.
3. Future research: This part will talk about what I think the solution is lacking and the direction for further research.
4. Reference: I will gather reference to prove my solution.
