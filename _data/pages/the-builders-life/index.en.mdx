# The builder's life

The goal of the series of articles is to collect and document the concept and experience of TotusLink, a knowledge management platform. From its inception to the present. How we started, what purpose we started building Totuslink for, the creation trajectory from zero to one, and an analysis of where the experience of writing program overlaps with my own writing.

These articles are intended not only to express my views, but also to show a path that is full of context, allowing people to glimpse TotusLink's path. 

The leaves cluster in shadows under the bright sun.
