This is a funny question, When will you write? Most of the time the answer will be: When I need to. Yes, writing is as simple as a tool, to express and share, document and expand, clarify and educate. 

But for this particular question, my answer is "When I feel solitary".

It is different from "When I feel lonely". The feeling of loneliness is the feeling of lacking something that you can't quite understand. But the feeling of "Solitary" is the feeling of smallness. When you look into some things, some people, some stories, or some idealogy. You feel what constructing yourself is just a small piece of the a puzzle. 

That is the moment I write.
