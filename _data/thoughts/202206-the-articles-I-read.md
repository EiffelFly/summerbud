This will be a long list. I will separate them into two categories, the first one is the articles that I found to be very interesting and insightful, the second part will be that the articles are generally interesting but I have arguments with them.

## INSIGHTFUL

These are all great essays, talking about porn, the internet, software, art, and business.

- [Inside the secret, often bizarre world that decides what porn you see - Patricia Nilsson and Alex Barker ](https://archive.ph/zXKuD#selection-1479.0-1484.0)
- [How Websites Die - Wesley Aptekar-Cassels](https://notebook.wesleyac.com/how-websites-die/)
- [Whatever happened to SHA-256 support in Git? - Jonathan Corbet](https://lwn.net/Articles/898522/)
- [αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε - Justine Tunney](https://justine.lol/ape.html)
- [Notes on a genre - Robin solan](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/notes-on-a-genre/)
- [Products are functions - Ryan Singer](https://www.feltpresence.com/functions.html)
- [How Do Individual Contributors Get Stuck? A Primer - Camille Fournier](https://www.elidedbranches.com/)

## INTERESTING

- [Synchronizing with Effects - React Docs Beta](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/synchronizing-with-effects)
  - This article further explains what is useEffect and its nature. Overall, a better doc compared to the old one. But after reading the whole article, I feel very confused about what happened to the useEffect, it's so counterintuitive and hard to master, not to say that the whole idea of combining lots of lifeCycle methods into just one hook is hard to use.
  - UseEffect is the number one reason that makes me want to leave the React ecosystem
- [Writing is hard - Tor Håkon](https://blog.torh.net/2022/06/14/writing-is-hard/)
  - Keep the flow of writing going!
- [You, Too, Can Be on the Cutting Edge of Functional Programming Research - James Hague](https://prog21.dadgum.com/138.html)
- [Angular without SSR is faster than Next.js with SSR. I have the data. - Alex Krupp](https://alexkrupp.typepad.com/sensemaking/2022/06/angular-without-ssr-is-faster-than-nextjs-with-ssr-i-have-the-data.html)
  - This article is interesting but on the other hand, it's somehow misleading, the way he gathered the data is fundamentally wrong due to he didn't separate different categories of a website like e-commerce or blog.
  - To see someone push extensively hard toward how to choose a framework is very nice.
- [Suboptimal naming conventions](https://cozilikethinking.wordpress.com/2022/06/06/suboptimal-naming-conventions/)
  - Naming is a double-edged sword, you could name it with very specific things like Nemesis or you could name it with some ambiguity like Beatles.
  - Ambiguity lead to more space for growing

## Short note

This month I mainly focus on technical articles or essays. It gives me a strange feeling that I spent about 5 hours per day reading novels back in junior and senior high school, but I seldom read novels right now. The reason is ambigus, but one of them is anxiety. It's hard to follow up the world, to correctly understand it or even have insight on it. This make me read more online essay but novels.

But would read lots of online essays help? I am not sure.
