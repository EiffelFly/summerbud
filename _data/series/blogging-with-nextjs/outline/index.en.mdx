I loves to write, novels, essays, or even technical articles. To make sense of the chaos, to find insights that no one else has. Walk through the flood of memories, picking out the ones worth keeping. And put it together. 

Hopefully, people who read these articles will be a little different from their old selves. The subtleties can only be discovered by oneself, and only in the course of daily life, such as noticing the weight of the commonly used kettle being different from the past or the pens on the shallow layer of the pencil box being smoother, and so on.

For me, as a carrier of words, blog is a palace that should be cleaned up and rectified by myself at any time.

It was only in this year that I came across the possibility of building this temple by hand, brick by brick. In this series of articles, I will describe how I built my own blog and what I learned in the process. I hope that anyone who stays here will also come to the idea that maybe I can build my own temple.
