This is a series of stories about a men who hate entrance exams, but have to sell digital textbooks for entrance exams.

After graduating from college, I came to Taichung to find a job in order to earn my tuition. I entered the business department of a digital textbook company that advertise all the class they have come from the most famous teacher.

I feel a great sense of conflict here. On the one hand, I strongly disagree with supplementary education under compulsory education and their values. On the other hand, because of my job, I had to work with a group of working students to make phone calls and preach to parents and students about the advantages of digital textbooks.

I made a variety of scripts, planned several models of how to deal with the situation, and taught this group of students who had just graduated from high school and had just finished their exams how to catch the opportunity in the endless phone calls, and finally transferred them to the group of business, and sealed the home visit and the deal.

I created a variety of scripts, planned several models of how to deal with some harsh situation, and taught this group of students how to seize the opportunity in the endless phone calls, and finally transferred them to the group of salesman, to seal the home visit and the deal.

I take 10% of the profit, no base pay.
