# Series

I like to write series of articles. The reason is that writing a novel is my ultimate goal.

The feel of writing is enhanced by years of practice, and even the way of thinking tends to divide complex topics into short chapters, which may not seem coherent on the surface, but are connected in a complex context in the depths.

Along that vein, there will always be a casual discovery of the author's secret. On the one hand, it doesn't cut corners, and on the other, it leaves only clues that can be deciphered for the most devious readers. That sense of wonder is mesmerizing.

I think this is the beauty of the novel. It is also the starting point of my writing.
