This is a series written by me after I took the entrance exam of the master degree of Taiwanese literature in 2018. It includes the preparation methods for various exam subjects, reading lists and my personal notes.

In addition, I also shared my thoughts on the preparation process, why do I want to enter the master degree? And what I'm trying to solve right now. These are all important records of me back then, and I hope to help those who are still crawling on the brambles.
