# township

We believe that a community of close discussion, high interaction, small quantity but great quality is the cornerstone of a better society.

township encourage and reward people constructing small but high quality community. We bring together the tools needed to run these communities, develop new discussion tools to increase the effectiveness of discussions, distribute the content communities created help then gain influence, and visualize the development of the community. 

## Origin

The journey begin with discussion about so called "discussion tools" with my partner. It seems a little bit jumping, but this is truely the foundation of township. We invent a new kind of discussion tool, combined with voice message and the training game of Japanese KTV. We try to accumulate the power of text message, for example, it can be replied, indexed and connected. In the meanwhile we design a new user interface to reserve the power of real-time disscusion tool like zoom and google meet.

However, in order to make it works, we need lots of iteration and users. So we decide to solve much more urgent problems first then introduce the discussion tool later.

After research, discussion and interviewed dozens of content producers, Podcaster, reading group host. We decide change our target user to these small but interactive communities like reading or discussion groups. They don's have a unified management platform, lack a centralized information center. They have always been a neglected element.

## Vision

We believe that a community of close discussion, high interaction, small quantity but great quality is the cornerstone of a better society. We expect township to be the backbone of this type of community for the foreseeable future.
